# HTTP Server

Rust http server from scratch.

Let's run the linter first:
```
cargo fmt
```

To build the server:
```
cargo build
```

To listen to (default) port 8080:
```
cargo run
```

By default, `/`, `/hello` and non-found routes are handled and html websites returned. Simple css syntax included.
